            <h3>Tango Argentino</h3>
            <p>if you are thinking about a weird stiff couple dancing with roses in their mouths, this is not Tango

Argentino..! This dance is about being able to improvise together, interpreting the music with

elegance, being aware of your body and your partner. It ́s very much like learning a language: we

teach you its basics, we explain the words and the possible dynamics, but it ́s up to you to

combine those elements to express yourself.

Anybody can dance Tango, whatever their dance skills and age: if you ́ve never danced anything

before, Tango Argentino is a great way to start, as it does not require any physical talent; if you ́re

a dancer, Tango will enhance your improvisation skills; if you ́re a couple dancer, it will improve

your communication skills dramatically. Basically there is no reason for not dancing Tango

Argentino! Come and join us :D</p>
